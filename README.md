## School_District_Analysis
Based on our project we could veryfied the school_type with better grades and with worst grades, as well as our reading and math scores per grade, per school_name as follow:

We could also veryfied our max & min scores per school:

If we would like to share to Maria a general overview of our students scores, we can use our "description function".

Once presented to Maria our analysis results, our next step is to work on strategies to improve the scores of our students.
